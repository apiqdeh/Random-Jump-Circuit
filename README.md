# QCP Project

This repository contains the **QCP (Quantum Computing and Programming Project)**, focused on the implementation and comparison of **approximate quantum counting methods**.

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate that **approximate quantum counting techniques** can be more **practical and resource-efficient** than the standard quantum counting approach, which is based on the combination of **Grover’s iterator** and **Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE)**.

Several approximate methods are implemented and analyzed, highlighting their advantages in terms of circuit depth, complexity, and suitability for near-term quantum devices. The implementations are developed using **Qiskit** and are provided in two equivalent formats:
- A Python script (`.py`)
- A Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`)
